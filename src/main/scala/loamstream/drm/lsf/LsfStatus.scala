 *
 * PEND The job is pending, that is, it has not yet been started.
 *
 * PROV The job has been dispatched to a power-saved host that is waking up. Before the job can be sent to the sbatchd, 
 *  it is in a PROV state.
 *
 * PSUSP The job has been suspended, either by its owner or the LSF administrator, while pending.
 *
 * RUN the job is currently running.
 *
 * USUSP The job has been suspended, either by its owner or the LSF administrator, while running.
 *
 * SSUSP The job has been suspended by LSF. 
 *  The job has been suspended by LSF due to either of the following two causes:
 *   The load conditions on the execution host or hosts have exceeded a threshold according to the loadStop vector 
 *   defined for the host or queue.
 *   The run window of the job's queue is closed. See bqueues(1), bhosts(1), and lsb.queues(5).
 *
 * DONE The job has terminated with status of 0.
 *
 * EXIT The job has terminated with a non-zero status. 
 *   It may have been aborted due to an error in its execution, or killed by its owner or the LSF administrator.
 *   For example, exit code 131 means that the job exceeded a configured resource usage limit and LSF killed the job.
 *
 * UNKWN mbatchd has lost contact with the sbatchd on the host on which the job runs.
 *
 * WAIT For jobs submitted to a chunk job queue, members of a chunk job that are waiting to run.
 *
 * ZOMBI A job becomes ZOMBI if:
 *   A non-rerunnable job is killed by bkill while the sbatchd on the execution host is unreachable and the job is 
 *   shown as UNKWN.
 *   The host on which a rerunnable job is running is unavailable and the job has been requeued by LSF with a new job 
 *   ID, as if the job were submitted as a new job.
 *   After the execution host becomes available, LSF tries to kill the ZOMBI job. Upon successful termination of the 
 *   ZOMBI job, the jobâ€™s status is changed to EXIT.
 *   With MultiCluster, when a job running on a remote execution cluster becomes a ZOMBI job, the execution cluster 
 *   treats the job the same way as local ZOMBI jobs. In addition, it notifies the submission cluster that the job 
 *   is in ZOMBI state and the submission cluster requeues the job.
